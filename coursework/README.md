Features of my application:
- Addition of bills to indvidual household
- Creation of households
- Creation of bills
- Notfication system that send the user notfication every time someone in the same bill pays or when added to a bill
- Distrubting bills depending on the number of users in the bill
- Settling payments between parties by telling them who paid with notfications and tell them when a bill is fully paid
- As an extra feature a user can be added to a bill even if they are not part of the household, or are not part of any
- Users can be added to multiple households. Although adding a bill to more than one household with the same user is not
recommended as the bill is only added once to the user which it can be an issue.
- Note: Users should split the names of other users and households they want to share the bill with with a ',' ]
